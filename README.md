#Wordle

A program called wordle that enables us to recreate this game and play it in our terminal instead. As the user executes the program, they decide, by providing a command-line argument with the length of the word they want to guess is, between 5 and 8 letters: 
`Usage: ./wordle wordsize`

Example:
```
$ ./wordle 5
This is WORDLE50
You have 6 tries to guess the 5-letter word I'm thinking of
Input a 5-letter word:

Have fun!
